* Move member function definitions to be static, in the c files. Can use them 
through their objects.
* Add autoconf support.
* Finish writing documentation. Will be using doxygen.
* Write Array/Multi to string routine to repack the data.
* Implement basic TCP/LLP listener.
* Write real unit tests. Using the make file to test is annoying.
