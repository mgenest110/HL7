HL7 message parser, in C.

Currently has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, and AntiX 
(Mepis) 8. (All Debian-based distributions of Linux.)

While I plan on adding autoconf support, for now just type 'make'.

The test currently requires you install the debug server into inetd.
As soon as I've finished a real listener (it's in the works), 
I'll fix that.
